Features

Brands can issue NFTs on their items with a QR Code and now users would be able to pay and purchase those items.

Our main usecase- Easier onboarding for new users. Imagine buying some merch from a shop and getting an associated NFT with it. Any future rewards or benefits can be airdropped straight into the wallet associated with that NFT. To self-custody, user can just move the top-level NFT from the merch shop's website into a wallet under their control, and all contained assets move with it.
