# SmartNFTs - Shop Smart with Smart NFTs with Best UX


Unique Brand Profiles for every user

Gasless Transactions, also known as meta-transactions, are transactions that have the gas fee paid for by a third party instead of the transaction sender.

Typically, this means the Brands cover the gas costs of their users' transactions, providing a more seamless user experience.

This works by having the user sign a message that is then sent to a relayer, which pays the gas fee and forwards the transaction to the blockchain.

Features

Brands can issue NFTs on their items with a QR Code and now users would be able to pay and purchase those items.

Our main usecase- Easier onboarding for new users. Imagine buying some merch from a shop and getting an associated NFT with it. Any future rewards or benefits can be airdropped straight into the wallet associated with that NFT. To self-custody, user can just move the top-level NFT from the merch shop's website into a wallet under their control, and all contained assets move with it.
